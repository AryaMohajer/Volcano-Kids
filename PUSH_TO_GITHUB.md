# Push to GitHub Instructions

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Volcano-Kids.git

# Ensure you're on main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Or if you prefer SSH:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/Volcano-Kids.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.
